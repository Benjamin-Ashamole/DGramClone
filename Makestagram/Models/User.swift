    /* From Lines 34-51
     1. Create a private static variable to hold our current user. This method is private so it can't be access outside of this class.
     2. Create a computed variable that only has a getter that can access the private _current variable.
     3. Check that _current that is of type User? isn't nil. If _current is nil, and current is being read, the guard statement will crash with fatalError().
     4. If _current isn't nil, it will be returned to the user.
     5. Create a custom setter method to set the current user.
     
     Now that we've created a User singleton, we need to make sure to set it. Once we receive the user from the database, we set the singleton with our custom setter method. After the singleton is set, it will remain in memory for the rest of the app's lifecycle. It will be accessible from any view controller with the following code:
     
     let user = User.current
     */
